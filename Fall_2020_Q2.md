### December 2020 Question 2

G - directed graph contains adjacency list. 
s - source
t - target


dfs_visit(G, u, discovered, finished)
  discovered.append(u)
  if u is t: //target
    print("reached to the target. No cycle detected")
    return
  for v in G.adj[u]:
    if v is in discovered: 
      print("cycle detected from u to v")
    if v is not in finished: 
      dfs_visit(G, v, discovered, finished)
  discovered.removed(u)
  finished.append(u)

DFS(G)
  discovered = [], finished = []
  discovered, finished = dfs_visit(G, s, discovered, finished)
```
