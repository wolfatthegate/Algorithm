Question #2:
Show the hash table after you insert the keys 5, 28, 19, 15, 20, 33, 12, 17, 10. Show the same hash
table after collisions are resolved by chaining. Moreover, show the hash table after inserting keys
using open addressing. Let the table have 9 slots and let the hash function be h(k) = k mod 9.




| key | h(k) = k mod 9   | 
| --- | ---------------- |
| 5   | h(5) = 5 mod 9   |
| 28  | h(28) = 28 mod 9 |
| 19  | h(19) = 19 mod 9 |
| 15  | h(15) = 15 mod 9 |
| 20  | h(20) = 20 mod 9 |
| 33  | h(33) = 33 mod 9 |
| 12  | h(12) = 12 mod 9 |
| 17  | h(17) = 17 mod 9 |
| 10  | h(10) = 10 mod 9 |
