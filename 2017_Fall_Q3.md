Demonstrate the insertion of the keys 4,27,18,14,19,32,11,16 into a hash table with
collisions resolved by linear probing. Assume that the table has 9 slots and that the hash
function is h(k) = k mod 9. Draw the state of the hash table after all insertions.
Propose strategies other than linear probing for handling collisions in a hash table. Are
they better, worse? 


In Open Addressing (closed hashing), all elements occupy the hash table itself. 
In Closed Addressing (open hashing), there can be more than one key in a slot. This method is called "Chaining".

| 4   | h(4) = 4 mod 9   |                |  1 | 4 |
